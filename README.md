# Image-to-3D-Model-Dataset
3D model retrieval based on 2D real images is to use 2D real images as input to retrieve relevant 3D models. This dataset is a cross-domain dataset based on the Princeton ModelNet project. By using online search engine collects 2D images of each type of 3D model, aiming to solve the problem of cross-domain data matching from 3D to 2D. By manually matching the 3D model view with the 2D real picture, delete the images that are not in the category of ModelNet40.
# 3D model perspective graph datasets
We collected Modelnet project common level 40 subsets (ModelNet40), per subset level including 80 training models and 20 test models, each of the 3D model has 12 views, the training-sets of each type of 3D model has 960 views and the test-sets has 240 views. 
Figure 1 shows a single model view of each class.
# 2D real images dataset
The real images corresponding to the 3D views are collected by the online search engine.
